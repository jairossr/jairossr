- 👋 Hi, I’m @jairossr  (Jai Ross)
- 👀 I’m interested in finding killer jobs for software developers!  
- 🌱 I’m currently studying some intense IT courses developed for nontechies.  There is a lot to learn but I am enjoying it!  
- 💞️ I’m looking to find amazing opportunities for the super talented developers in my network. If you have collaborative teams, interesting projects, great work culture, and an appreciation for dedicated software engineers, let's talk!  
-    If you are a developer that might consider the right opportunity in the future, let's connect.  As a tech recruiter, I am committed to providing IT pros with an exceptional experience, which means I stay in communication, respect the time of all parties, and share information honestly.  I'm learning more about tech as I go, to be the best possible resource for my candidates!
